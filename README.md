A Global Game Jam 2019 game.

Going outside is overrated. If you want to stay inside you have to make sure that you don't become a horrible, filthy mess. Keep yourself fed, rested, clean and entertained while fighting enemies that slowly worsen your condition. If any of your stats reach zero, it means this amazing lifestyle has consumed you and you should really go outside.
